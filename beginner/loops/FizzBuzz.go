ASSIGNMENT
We're hiring engineers at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game,
a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the fizzbuzz function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line,
but substitutes multiples of 3 for the text fizz and multiples of 5 for buzz.
For multiples of 3 AND 5 print instead fizzbuzz.

	for i := 1; i <= 100; i++ {
		if i%3 == 0 {
